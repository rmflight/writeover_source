If anyone bothers to ask, we can tell another.”\nThis Ks’ou, who should have been his enemy, said these words as she shifted her weight on the edge of the vault of their damaged ship, then pushed one of the last bottles of water in his direction. It rolled to him easily. He picked it up and tried to suppress the hint of disgust as he drank, but he could not help the display, obvious as a Human grimace. To make this moment worse, the breeze was not so kind as to be cool; still, it was night, and so, between the dust above and the sand below they heaved a collective, if not somewhat forced, sigh of relief from the onslaught that mid-day wrought.\nHe brushed off the feeling of dis-ease: he wasn’t really sharing water with a Ksou.\nShe’ll be dead soon. This didn’t count.\nHer chosen name was Aurana. She wasn’t looking at him, but was instead intensely staring at the old device she held in her hand, small enough to fit in the palm of it. Clunky as it was, he was grateful—it brought them music of the Human kind. For Efyir, this sound was hard to like, but by now Aurana had figured out what he preferred and what he despised. She was far less picky. How they negotiated with one another was often over which song they could agree to listen to together.\nHis father named him Efyir-Azayim, but he had pushed thoughts of his father far from his mind in this moment. He was watching closely to her hand movements on the device. He was trying, politely, not to look at her neck, and failing. Even in the moonlight, the pulses at the top of her exposed neck were unmistakeable. She ignored his gaze and after awhile, began:\n“Promise me…”\n“I’ve made enough false promises between us,” Efyir said abruptly.\nBut Aurana smiled. “Promise me you’ll tell your father. That we ruined the title of his book.”\nImpossible Discourse. Well, it was a start. Not a perfect one.\nShe was again clicking the device, until it finally landed on a song that she knew would please both of them. The earphones were the kind that you stuck in your ear. The one he held fit ill in his Thhiyatkhoor earlobe, but at the right angle the rich sound filed out of the instrument and into his mind. The sound they shared: the other earbud stretched out and was inserted in the ear of a human. Not just a human: a human occupied by a Ks’ou.\nHe tried not to think about that.\nThe song ended. The intentional clicks of the device sounded again as she frantically searched for another song that would be agreeable to them both. He very obviously closed the top of the bottle and rolled it back to her, which she caught without looking up but did not bring to her lips.\n“I’m sorry you will die.” He finally said it. He’d wanted to say it all day. The clicks stopped for only a moment, and then continued again, as if motivated by a frantic compulsion.\n“Don’t be ridiculous. When has a Thhiyatkhoor ever been sorry over a Ks’ou death?” As if to answer her own question, she took a quick sip of water, closed the top and rolled it back to him.\nShe was right. He corrected: “I’m sorry that my actions lead to your untimely death… I still have to truth-tell, per our custom. This is a final battle.”\n“The battle is over. I failed.”\n“The battle isn’t over. It’s shifted.” He wasn’t feeling very argumentative—it seemed to issue naturally whenever he was around her. “It is now towards the life of your human, who will remain after you die tomorrow. And my own life. So I truth-tell… I would like to think the General will be pleased to be corrected on a point that was his life’s work. So, yes, I will tell him. Perhaps he will be compelled to change his title.” That last point was an embellishment. Knowing his father, he wouldn’t.\nShe smiled thinly, still unsatisfied.\n“So promise me…” she spoke, hoping to push him, further. Relentless. Exhausting. Intriguing. “That you’ll tell him how powerful our resistance is? That he won’t need to send a fleet?”\nEfyir could make no such promise. It wasn’t even certain that he would survive this to deliver the message. But he could say, “The General knows the dangers of this. He is fond of humans, against Thhiyatkhoor custom. He will want to protect them as best as possible.”\n“El.” He cringed. The nickname she’d given him once meant more than it did now. She had put the device down so that there was no sound between them, except the rustling of emptiness throughout the sand dunes. “Are we allies?”\nThe branches on his head stretched out into the darkness. They could reach out, like wisps of thread, and feel the air far around them. He could feel the emptiness of plenitude they were compressed between: billions of tiny holes in the sky and billions of rocks below them under the ship, still radiant with the day’s heat.\n“First encounters can never be replicated, and ours was built on the absence of truth. You didn’t tell me what you were. And I didn’t tell you my name.” A burst of sound interrupted. She’d found the song, although he suspected she was compromising, because there were elements he knew she didn’t like. He talked through it. “But sleep is no longer relevant. So… we have a few hours left to try.” He turned to her so that he was looking at the human, directly, and could no longer see the back of her neck where Aurana pulsed discreetly. “If Ana promises me something.”\n“What is that?”\n“That she’ll finish your book. A Brief History of Human Colonization. Even when you die.” This place was miserable. It was still too hot; he could see it on her face. There would be no more arguing. No more sparring, either.\nAurana nodded, then gulped, as if gasping for air. It would be time, soon. There was not enough water for them both. Soon, not enough for any of them. He had forgotten to take a sip, and hoped she hadn’t noticed, either. He pushed the water back in her direction but she stopped it mid-roll, and did not move to lift if to her human’s lips. He did not urge her to drink from it, despite a strange compulsion in him to say so. It wasn’t right. It wasn’t his place.\nThe texts labeled ‘history’ would tell one story—that was certain. His father had learned this lesson the hard way. If only her human could finish the book. Perhaps they could tell another.\n Next Chapter\n"});index.add({'id':1,'href':'/symbiosisnovel/chapters/chapter-1/','title':"Chapter 1 (Kelisfton)",'content':" “Flesh describes an alien entity, a more or less expendable figure…\nits most poignant determination is the extent to which such a body cannot prevent or ward off another\u0026rsquo;s touch. The single-most powerful evidence of the loss of freedom is the fact that bodies lose their integrity and may be \u0026gt;invaded or entered… by coercive power. This touch that we associate with intimacy… becomes instead the power to wound and violate.”\n Hortense Spillers1\n Previous Chapter\nThey were beautiful; I would destroy them.\nThe planet of the newly discovered creatures, the Olyat-Koi, appeared in the screen before me and my team of warrior-Settlers. It was small, with only one continent visible from the exosphere where we lay in wait, and these aliens as I had come to understand them seemed placable enough. Trained in intercepting and decoding messages, I happened upon a Thhiyatkhoor transmission which had given these coordinates. Under the guise to my superiors that I was making a simple investigation, a curiosity about a planet I heard about by rumor, I set a course for the Olyat-Koi homeworld. I didn’t want any nosy overseers following and trying to take over what was rightfully my discovery.\nIf the Thhiyatkhoor were here, they would be so peacefully, as the messages had indicated. I wanted to know what they were doing, and if these new creatures were suitable for settling.\nIn the corner, the short, bipedal creature, with tan flesh and a black nest shooting from its head, began to whimper. The creature, a gift from one of my allies and confidantes, was designated to be used for research missions. But a Commander could use research for only one thing.\nThe whimpering grew louder. Why now? I needed to concentrate. “||Quiet that thing||,” I hissed. Not even my own shell of a settled made such noise as this mewling thing had since the transfer had been made to this ship. A soldier, in an elongated body pinched at the waist, raised one of its weapons, but the ensuing clatter into short creature’s skull would not come. I took one immediate leap and slammed the soldier’s head into the wall, pushing so that a trickle of dark blue blood began to emit from its ears: “||I did not say kill it. I need that thing for my project. Are you trying to sabotage me||?”\n“Adê (No),” the soldier whimpered. It sounded as pathetic as the little creature, now, who had quietened and was looking up at us both with widened eyes. I calculated: I could not afford to lose another soldier, nor was it worth losing patience over what amounted to mere vibrations in the air. I released him so he would slide to the floor. To the short thing I said, “||Carry on your irritating and arbitrary noise-making||,” knowing that the stupid thing didn’t understand my language. This would be remedied when I released my current creature and Settled the small one, connecting to its neural pathways as I was biologically designed to do. But not yet.\nAs if on cue it began making noises again. I conceded that if I were as small as it, with so much exposed flesh despite the long sheet of thin fabric covering from just below the head to its lower body, I would perhaps have cause for worry, too. The Ks’ou and it were not much different in that respect—our bodies are vulnerable, unlike the hardened, mosaic bodies of the multitudinously-formed creature I currently possessed, or—I thought this with an inward joy as I turned my attention back to the screen—the Olyat-Koi, whose bodies were as formidable and strong as their minds. The best hosts were sharp in both, as these were rich resources that the Ks’ou could mine for our own purposes. Lost in the thought of finally landing on the planet, executing the plan, and retrieving the exemplar, I was able to push away the sound of the short creature’s bleats as my mind flooded with images of conquest.\nThis would be a day, perhaps, named after me for celebration. I was saving the Olyat-Koi from their illusions of peace. I would bring the galaxy to them, to hold them honorable above all other species.\nIn case you were wondering: there are no heroes in this story. There are those who do heroic acts, and there are moments of courage. Do not consider any of us heroes; we are all only villains until the very moment of our dying breath, until our being is taken into account.\n Next Chapter\n   Reference lost. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "});index.add({'id':2,'href':'/symbiosisnovel/chapters/chapter-2/','title':"Chapter 2",'content':" Previous Chapter\nNeVarr\u0026ndash;and by default, James\u0026ndash;were standing in front of the tank. The edges on the wide afro of the human glowing slightly aquamarine in its light. The Ks\u0026rsquo;ou formed the humans lips and sent the signals to vibrate the throat: it was a quiet mumble, as they shook a flaky substance onto the open top of the water. A couple of snails were stuck to the side of the tank; the fish that remained from the last fiasco were maneuvering calmly throughout the seagrass that NeVarr had recently planted.\nThey had had cuttlefish some time ago before both Aurana and Ana finally convinced NeVarr to give up once the latest one had died. He mourned a little longer than was appropriate; Aurana reminded him sharply that they weren’t sentient as Ks’ou were. Ana invoked a gentleness that humans were so good at: she knew that the resemblance of Ks’ou to cuttlefish was close, and reminded him that cuttlefish were limited with their eight arms and inability to speak back despite NeVarr’s numerous attempts to detach from his human and crawl into the tank with them and make contact.\nNeVarr refused to believe it at first. “If it’s true they aren’t sentient, how can they have eyes? WE Ks’ou don’t even have eyes. And yet they can’t communicate?”\n“Having eyes and communicating sentiently are two different things.”\nThey thought once he’d given up on cuttlefish-raising that he was done, but he diligently kept the tank thriving, with almost six or seven creatures—two fish, two snails, and some crustaceans—seeming to be swimming happily now that their cuttlefish predator was gone.\nSo was the scene that Aurana, in Ana, walked in to as they returned from their recent KLF solo mission: NeVarr, in James, humming evenly, as though reciting a poem.\n“They can’t hear you,” Aurana said mildly, locking the front door behind them. “And even when we’ve attempted to communicate via our natural tongue in water, all studies have pointed to no signs of conscience.”\nNeVarr ignored her, continuing to speak rhythmically. After a moment, he stood and observed her, noting the blood in her sleeve and gesturing towards his own cheek to show that hers wasn’t quite clean. She dragged her human’s hand against it instinctively; NeVarr sighed, “Do you think it’s true? That we all began on the same planet, even humans? That every thing, in the entire universe, was once… of one kyôsta?”\n“It’s an interesting theory. Unconfirmed and likely uncomfirmable. A creation story, as any other.”\nNeVarr snorted rudely. “You don’t even care for your human’s creation story.”\n“It doesn’t taste,” Aurana responded. Such was the Ks’ou way of interpreting the world, even this one largely devoid of water.\n“Our job as symbiotes is to taste any thing that has been robbed of us,” NeVarr said cooly. “Air thriving. The life of mind. Tasting.”\n“You taste more than most Ks’ou,” Aurana said, grinning thinly, gazing past NeVarr to the kitchen, where a mess invariably await. “What will you do when we are back on kyôsta and you are no longer allowed to eat with a tongue?”\nHe nodded. “It’s the only thing that would convince me to stay on Earth.” Preemptively he held out a hand to stay her shocked expression, “Relax, relax. Obviously we have to leave when the war is over, and that includes leaving our humans, too. I’m just dreaming impossibility. Can I do that, at least?”\nAurana threw their bags on the couch, a gesture she knew would annoy NeVarr to no end, because the only mess he failed to recognize was the one he created in the kitchen. She sat her human’s body down and illuminated the screen, but none of the images that passed sight interested her. It was a far cry than from when she first learned ‘sight,’ as with eyes, when all things were fascinating. Now it was dull; repetitive.\nNeVarr sat himself and his human, James, down next to them on the other side of the couch. They watched in silence for moments before she spoke.\n“You’re dressed like a jackass clown. Are you going to DJ again tonight?”\nShe never looked at him, but could hear him, burning at the cheeks.\nHe made a small choking sound. “Please don’t tell Ana. Is she listening, now?”\n“She’s not listening to us,” Aurana said haughtily. “She’s in the archive.”\n“You know about this? The club?”\n“Ana tells me everything,” Aurana said calmly, tearing her human’s eyes away from the screen to give NeVarr a pointed look. “Unlike some Ks’ou present, I don’t need to take information from my human that she freely gives.”\n“That was only in the beginning,” NeVarr said defensively. His eyes narrowed, as though challenging her. He even licked his lips slightly, his unconscious habit. “Besides…” he frowned, his eyebrows narrowing, “She doesn’t tell you everything.”\n“Doesn’t she?”\nNeVarr had a way of pushing his human’s expression into something unreadable, his eyes were wide and bright. “What’s my favorite food?”\nShe scoffed. “We’re Ks’ou. We’re not supposed to have a single favorite food.”\n“Well, I do. And Ana knows it.” He pushed his human lips into a thin, triumphant line. “Your human doesn’t tell you everything.” He’d said this with an unnecessary finality, returning to the moving light on the screens, but she could tell he wasn’t paying attention.\nAfter some time, NeVarr continued, as though excusing himself, “I’ve limited my club time because of Ana. I’m on call for emergencies only. Only because of what happened…”\n“I know what happened,” Aurana snapped. She didn’t, in fact, but she was testing him. He didn’t fall for it.\n“Kwa. Aurana. Did you know…” he hesitated. “The KLF has charged me. Me. I’m not supposed to inform you, my Sub Aspirant, about it.”\nAurana glanced at him, but his gaze was not directly back at her. Instead, he looked towards the table, where a simple white sheet lay.\n“I’ve only partially deciphered it. But it… I know, already, that it’s beyond anything I’ve ever done. I’m not ready. I can’t do it alone.”\nAurana noted his worry, and, as was typical, did not let emotion overcome her visage. Humans felt much; Ks’ou did, too. It could be embraced without being indulged. “You’ll be fine, NeVarr. This is good news. They want to promote you.”\nNeVarr scoffed. “Or kill me.”\nShe ignored him, “Let’s decipher it completely, together, and then I can help you plan what to do.” He didn’t look fully convinced so she sighed and said, “Remember the Protocols.”\n“You and these Protocols.”\n“They’re useful. I say them to myself when I have trouble sleeping.”\n“There’s something very wrong with you,” he said, arching the eyebrows of his human, but sighed and said, “Just the first two, okay?”\nTogether, they repeated: “Protocol 1. Subset 1. We aim to dismantle the Ks\u0026rsquo;ou Nation, fully and without exception. Protocol 1. Subset 2. We aim to re-establish Ks\u0026rsquo;ou as a peaceful presence in the universe.”\nThere were more, many more. And Protocol Sifr, of course, but that one was so burned into their founds, so foundational, so utterly necessary to everything the KLF aimed to do, that they never found it necessary to say aloud.\nProtocols 1.1. and 1.2 usually sufficed. To remind them what set them apart. To remind them the levity of what they needed to shift. She convinced NeVarr to repeat Protocols 1.1 and 1.2 three times over. The third, NeVarr actually smiled and said, “You’re right. That did make me feel better. So many Ks’ou have failed to succeed at Protocol 1.2. We’re all really bad at it. Why should I expect to do any better?”\n\u0026ndash;\nThe greatest true stories they knew—and Aurana had the greatest repository of stories in the known universe—began with births and deaths. Which is why this begging human, whimpering on his knees, struck them both as a great tragedy.\nEarlier, Aurana and Ana were staring at a single Human face in the mirror: braids to shoulder blades, dark brown eyes, skin that Ana’s mother often said was like sequoias, not just because its shade was a mix between hers and her father’s, but also because these trees were rare, and the last few were isolated in containment for scientific preservation. Apparently they had visited one when she was younger, much younger, but war had devastated most of these. Their trunks remained, and that was why her mother called Ana Sequoia, sometimes, because she believed that, despite struggle, she could remain firmly rooted in herself, her convictions, her family, many of whom she had never met, only holding stories from which she drew threads, senses, sketches.\n{ Your mother was not wrong. }\n{ Stop reading my mind, } Ana snapped, but knew that she had been, once again, thinking too loudly.\nAna took off her earrings, the katydids that most people mistook for leaves, the last visible connection of her first home, the last that she had shared with her sister.\n“My hair needs to be shorter,” Ana grumbled, knowing this was not possible. She regarded her curls, the way they sagged in the mirror, lamenting how tight they could have been were they not so heavy with length.\nAurana did not care much for hair, only to the extent that it covered her human’s neck: { We’re here for the Human. } a gentle reminder. Thoughts were easily lost in tangled webs. NeVarr had already detailed the report on Friday, which meant that Ana had to catch Aurana up today.\n{ Offender on two counts of pro-Nation assaults. Offender of colonial resonance. Offender of Human legally-defined trafficking activities. } Language that was once foreign to Ana had now become everyday words.\n{ So it will be easy, then, } Aurana thought. No need to differentiate between Human and Ks’ou. No need to coax the Ks’ou out, as it were.\n{ Not quite. }\nIt was not difficult infiltrating the hospital. Both the human and the Ks’ou knew already its landscape. Ana’s sister was located in this same building, in another wing, indefinitely, until she recovered or humans decided otherwise. This was the death side of things.\nThe birth? This was currently happening in one room over of the birthing hall of this place. They need only wait for the human father to take a break, to use the restroom, which he did in the 13 hour ordeal that struck Aurana as both lengthy and, given what the human had to deal with, painfully slow.\nKs’ou do not give birth this way. Ks’ou laid eggs to be inspired, and that was that. The event of a Ks’ou birth was not considered an event; Ks’ou were considered ‘born’ in other ways.\nBut here it was—a birth, a presumed death, to come. Ana and Aurana had peeked inside the door while everyone was occupied. Before them both: a human woman, with brown hair intertwined with silver, trying to issue life into human hands, on her back while the body screamed and squirmed. Her intent was to give life; the other life-giver, the biological father, was, however, slated to die. He was situated on the other side of the table, playing his part. The lie was in his presence. They knew the one moving the male, charcoal and grey body wasn’t actually the father: they knew it was a Ks’ou, controlling the human, pretending to be engaged in this beautifully horrific orchestra of human blood and other fluids.\nProper Ks’ou births used to be in etaoin; humans translated this as lagoons but it is not accurate. The Nation, the overarching organization of the Ks’ou species, disrupted this. Soon there was no etaoin. Soon, there was only the call for war, and instead of in etaoin, Ks’ou were born in cold, inorganic ships.\nAnd then it was his time, to succumb to the biological faculties of the human. And their time to strike. She waited until he was in the hallway, and pulled him, unwillingly into another room. Aurana had dressed her human, Ana’s, body in the warrior clothes of the terrorist group they aspired to join, a gift from a mutual friend.\nThe human’s eyes widened at the sight of their uniform. “I know you,” he shuddered. This was a lie: he knew nothing about her. He knew of her, but no more. She was a new subject, and attacked him accordingly. In moments that they tumbled she had freed the human, temporarily, from Ks’ou control.\n“Choose, human,” Aurana hissed when the blinking, confused human entered the reality that the Ks’ou had denied him. Ana readied her body for their transfer; death came from her, the human, alone.\n“I know you can’t answer this,” this father-to-be said, “But how strong are you? The KLF? I just… is freedom close? Would it be worth it, to wait, for my daughter?”\n“You’re right,” she said, looking away for fear that her terrible awkwardness for lying would betray information that she couldn’t give. “I can’t answer that. But I can tell you this: don’t look to the KLF for your freedom. It is something humans will secure for yourselves, from your own colonizer.”\n“Yeah,” he mumbled, the sobriety of it like a brick struck against his face. He began twitching.\n“Your Ks’ou will regain control soon,” she said. “I’m sorry, We need your decision.”\n“I don’t have an answer,” he said, finally, holding up a hand, extending and retracting it as though he were testing to see the very moment that it would return to control of the Ks’ou. “I want to see my baby girl. But I don’t want this monster to lay a finger on her.” He laughed, sadly, as though he had just made a great joke. “My wife has always accused me of being impatient.”\nJust then they could hear her very screams through the wall, not quite the blood-curdling scream of a human whose life was about to end; this sounded closer to a great and powerful cry, peaking, apparently, to the crowning finality of a newborn birth.\n—\nA Brief History of Human Colonization\nIt is clear that the Ks’ou alien Colonizers functioned as a disruption to the Human historical timeline. Humans, Earth-wide, would never be the same as before the Ks’ou arrived on Earth, and the nature of Ks’ou control would obliterate and disrupt Human-driven possibility. This has never before been made so clear as the introduction of the terms ‘Pre-Ks’ou Era’ (PKE) and ‘Post-Ks’ou Era’ (PsKE) in many Earth-published textbooks; though these terms are charged and used sparingly here, it should be noted that this work before you is written in 39 PsKE. The small years of the Ks’ou failed attempt at colonization will be simply referred to as ‘KE.’ To be sure, Humans were colonizers before the arrival of the Ks’ou. Not all Human colonization can be considered the same across all Human contexts.1 The title of this work is not to imply that ‘Human’ indicates an essential, singular form of colonization. That ‘Human’ serves as a metonym for ‘all’ or ‘universal’ is an unfortunate implication in some (though not the majority of) Human languages. The purpose of this work is to explore the nature of Human-driven colonization across different geographical, political, and cultural contexts on the third planet from Sol (formerly the ambiguously named ‘Sun’) in the Human Solar System within the galaxy that Humans refer to as the Milky Way. By privileging the era of Human history before the Ks’ou arrival, when time was designated ‘CE’ or ‘AD’ and ‘BCE’ or ‘BC’, the authors aim to provide initial thoughts toward how Human colonization shaped the reaction towards subsequent Ks’ou colonization. Through the lens of the writers, the PKE can never fully be torn apart from the PsKE, though the former was never fully shaped by it, either. Across the galaxy, may we be comforted in the fact that all species share one trait: we are all the artifacts of our histories, whether we remember this history or not…\n—\nTheir path home was pervaded by the quiet sound of water flickering off leaves. The temperature was dropping, but slowly, so that they trudged over the muddy floor of a forest between seasons. Beads of water still clung to the edges of branches, like unsettled dust. They both felt that it was good to be engulfed by something taller, something bigger than themselves. This had the power to ease a heart likewise engulfed in quiet war. Their shadows, and the dim light through the tops of the trees, had a calming effect.\nIt was when they approached the clearing that they saw it—there, on the top of the trees, the slender body, the ridged head and, though an outline of a shadow, a set of horns extending from the back of its head called naghryoja. It was aiming a weapon: Aurana could see the glint of the moon on its surface.\nShe slipped her own weapon out of her pocket, extended it, and aimed. Not many Thhiyatkhoor graced the Earth these days, enough in number only that this chance encounter did not seem out of place. What was this one doing so high in this tree? Did it not know not to expose itself? Of course. Typical Thhiyatkhoor arrogance. Earth was hardly a threat, though she had heard of Human attempts to kidnap Thhiyatkhoor for money—most by now surely realized that Thhiyatkhoor did not discourse in Human sums, that battle was their currency. If one were to fell a Thhiyatkhoor on accident, adequate payback would involve dealing with their enemies, the greatest of these the Ks’ou, rivals from the beginning.\nBut a purposeful kidnapping? Aurana was tempted. She would never give him over to the miserable Nation, but the Ks\u0026rsquo;ou Liberation Front could use him for their aims to upend and defeat the Ks’ou force currently wreaking its havoc on Humans; Ks’ou anti-Nation liberators wanted an end to the war that had devastated their people, that had destroyed the Universe’s consideration of their species.\nAurana aimed, but the glint of the object the Thhiyatkhoor held caught her eye. Was it really a weapon? Through the pistonet’s viewer she adjust for a closer look. The object that she imagined was a weapon seemed round and clear, except for inside. There, they saw a swirling sphere, deep blue and green and brown as lush planets are, and there were clouds as well as light streaks, a shining lace of phosphoric luminescence, that cut through the bodies of terra.\nUnlike Earth, this planet’s landmass was largely connected in a band that clustered toward the center, a band that humans would refer to as an ‘equator’. Many peninsulas speckled the large bodies of water north and south of this center, but they were hardly visible in this opthastre.\nIt didn’t matter. There it was, entirely.\nkyôsta!\nShe imagined that she had thought this, but as her ears trembled, she realized that this Thhiyatkhoor was saying it also, over and over again; his narrow, sharp lips moved in the dark. She shifted the viewer towards his head instead, to discern his expression, and to see his mouth, if it were true what she was too far away to hear.\nHer finger slipped.\nShe could see the shot, though tiny, tearing the air apart.\nAurana stood her human’s body in frozen horror. She had never unintentionally triggered her weapon before—was always precise, until now.\n{ Don’t worry. I got you. } Ana whispered her assurance. Aurana dared to look upwards and understood: Ana had sensed the mistake she was about to make, shifted her physical hands so the shot missed him by moments. The Thhiyatkhoor was, thankfully, unscathed, but he was now looking directly towards them.\nWhen they looked through the viewfinder again, the Thhiyatkhoor was gone. She could see the movement of the trees but could not hear its rustling, could barely hear the deftness as he tore, quietly, through the branches at an impossibly quick speed. Anxiety gripped her; she did not fear, was accustomed to battle, but she did not have enough information to discern how she should prepare for what would occur next. She knew that running would be foolish—Thhiyatkhoor were excellent tree-runners—but to remain would risk a provocative wrath. She could only stand still to see what kind of Thhiyatkhoor this one was. The leaves that rustled sounded as the wind; she could not discern where, exactly it was, until a sudden shake just in front of her.\nThe creature swung down in a simultaneous stomp of both its legs, only minute spaces in front of her. Thhiyatkhoor are not particularly beautiful creatures: with slim, angular bodies and little shapeliness except for the sharp of their arm blades, there was not much to them except outline. Aurana concluded that they were like muscular seaweed— perhaps dangerous muscular seaweed. Ana of course disagreed: she liked the Thhiyatkhoor crown, as she called it, but these, even round, were only an extension of Thhiyatkhoor, and not the Thhiyatkhoor itself. Humans at least had a little roundness that made sense. Yet being Ks’ou and thus born without sight, it ultimately didn’t matter: who was she to judge what was pretty and what wasn’t?\nHe brought forward his three formidable arm blades; struck against her small weapon she now used as a tiny shield. She swung her other arm and missed, purposefully, to show him a rhythm he did not understand, causing enough confusion for her to deal a blow to his jaw. He was unfazed; her human’s hand throbbed. As they clashed again, he leaned in close as though to intimidate her. His blades could fell thick branches, and her weapon, though long enough to act as a thin shield, was beginning to give. He was obviously warrior class, notably in the interim pauses of this initial scuffle, the ways his eyes shifted over the body of her human, assessing speed and estimating their next movements.\nShe knew, also, that this attack was restrained, so it was no surprise when the caveat came, his eyes shining night against night. “You attempt an attack?”\nHe spoke low. Thhiyatkhoor voices tended to be tonic; their throats and palates are curved differently than humans, so it made it notoriously difficult for humans to understand what Thhiyatkhoor found important, and lead to many different misunderstandings between the history of their races. No misunderstanding as deep as between Ks’ou and Thhiyatkhoor, though. The sound that Aurana was so used to—a sound had become normal to her, like rushing water, a high-pitched hum, that had nestled itself into the creases of her mind, suddenly diminished, like a wave breaking suddenly to become calm. The voice of this Thhiyatkhoor cut through it like the bow of a ship through saltwater. It was the first thing she noticed about him. But she couldn’t stay with this thought long enough to make it salient, and so quickly forgot it.\n“Yy- You’re a Thhiyatkhoor.” She could try to feign ignorance. So said the stupidest thing that came to mind. His response did not disappoint.\n“Obviously.” His slate flared superiority. A brief shine over a slower diffused cloudburst, like grey and white wisps passing aside a full moon. Ana had only seen Thhiyatkhoor in books, so Aurana took her awe at his skin emotions and expressed it as her own.\n“What are you doing on Earth?”\n“What are you doing with that weapon?”\n“Nothing,” she said, exaggerating her human’s embarrassment. She held up both arms, the weapon dangling from the thumb of one, wondering how many details of her face he could see in the light wind. “A misfire. I’m sorry. I’ve never seen a live Thhiyatkhoor before.”\nFor her this was a lie, and she was still learning how to do these, but what did a Thhiyatkhoor know of good or bad lying in a Human context? He hesitated, regarded her with his dark eyes. The sphere—humans referred to it as an opthastre and she couldn’t remember the word in Endaithsu—glowed in his hand.\n“Can I see it?” she asked honestly. “The thing, you have—the marble. I will lay my weapon down; honest, I only was using it as a telescope to see what you were holding in the moonlight, and I did not know the trigger was activated.”\nAs a “Human,” she placed her weapon on the ground timidly. Aurana was invoking every aspect of Ana, the early Ana, the pre-war child, the unborn, that she could.\n“We are in a time of peace,” she said. Earth’s unprecedented peace—even for Earth—was propaganda, of course, begun by humans themselves and now perpetuated by Settlers. But at 39 PsKE, human memory waned, and now that more of the universe was open to them, so, too, the whelm of distraction.\n“Excessive peace,” the Thhiyatkhoor mumbled. He glanced at the opthastre. “It is civilian grade.” Reluctantly, he placed it into her hands, while staring directly at her grounded weapon as he did. The opthastre, close to 3 inches in diameter, contained within it the real-time projection of an image that she thought she’d never see in her lifetime.\n“This is my place of origin, my kyôsta,” he said as she held up the swirling planet to her eyes. He glanced towards her ear and neck, but it was useless: though she did not sport the zilaa2 sign, she wore a scarf that covered her neck and the edge of her ear, and was still firmly wrapped there despite the intensity of this initial battle. “Kyôsta being the word for ‘home’ in my native language.”\n“I figured that.” Her tone was coarse, but she looked at this creature, this tall, slate, Thhiyatkhoor, the shadows of his adolescent naghryoja cutting against the stars in the backdrop. Gauged him. “Do you miss it?”\n“My Human hosts have been as family to me since before I formed branches. But when I see what my planet looks like from the outside, perhaps that thing you call ‘missing’ is what I experience.”\nShe twitched, annoyed. It is not your planet, she wanted to sneer. Not alone. But Thhiyatkhoor speak this way, of course, because they have succeeded in making, marking, and manifesting their planet as their own. He was between child and adulthood, likely similar to her own interplanetary measure of passing. She pushed aside these political thoughts and regarded the sphere, which held an image she had hardly seen; Ks’ou were not allowed to think of this kyôsta as kyôsta-sy, though it framed their indigeneity.\nIt had been years since she had even seen her own planet of her birth, but this was different: she had never seen projections of the original kyôsta such as this. Spheres of this kind were not technology bestowed to her species.\nShe held it back out to him, with some resistance, “Thank you. Your so-called kyôsta is a beautiful place. Perhaps Humans can visit one day.” This laughable proposition was something Ana was thinking, loudly, and therefore a real text that Humans might speak.\n“Perhaps.” He made a rude sound, one that Aurana likened to scoffing; wordlessly, he took the sphere back. What more did he want? Argument? Understanding? Meaning? But he seemed stalled. She picked up her weapon again and stuffed it into her pocket to begin heading out of the forest starred.\n   Wolfe, Patrick. “Comparing Colonial and Racial Regimes.” 2013 lecture. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwj5bcLG8ic \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n zilaa: Non-Earther (a term from Izlaa, the Universal language) \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "});index.add({'id':3,'href':'/symbiosisnovel/chapters/','title':"All Chapters",'content':"Chapters #  "});})();
