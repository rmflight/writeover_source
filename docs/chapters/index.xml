      <description>“The texts labeled ‘history’ tell one story. If anyone bothers to ask, we can tell another.”

      <description>“Flesh describes an alien entity, a more or less expendable figure…
its most poignant determination is the extent to which such a body cannot prevent or ward off another&amp;rsquo;s touch.

He argues that Narration can be looked at separately through the lense of these two different relationships: temporal (time) and spatial (space). These two components express a particular worldview or ideology depending on the genre of literature you find it in.</description>
